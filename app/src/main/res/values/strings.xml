    <string name="abt">What distinguishes a great school from a good school? I believe that clarity of purpose, exceptional teachers, and demonstrated outcomes are hallmarks of great schools. A great school is a place with a deep commitment to student learning, where faculty nourish the intellectual, moral, emotional, and social growth of every student. It is a place where students, teachers, and parents embark together on an academic journey with clear and well-defined objectives. It is filled with the joy of discovery and the excitement of personal challenge and growth. It is a community dedicated to developing strength of character and excellence in all dimensions of its students\' lives. And it is a place that has a distinctive and lasting impact.</string>
